### About
This is not a library, just sample implementation. 
The main aim of this app is to be an example of how to build a Dominant Color Background like Spotify.
I made a json file that includes artist names and album covers and uploaded it to github.
I got the data with Retrofit2 and used the ViewPager2 to slide and show album covers similar to Spotify.
With help of Glide and Palette, I found the dominant color and make it gradient background.


### Libraries and Tools Used
- Retrofit2
- ViewPager2
- Hilt Dagger
